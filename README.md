# 👋 Hi there, I'm Moein!

## 🌟 About Me

I'm an MSc Computer Science student at the University of Milan, passionate about **cloud data engineering** and **video game development**. I love designing scalable systems that bring data to life—and when I’m not working with pipelines, I’m building pixel worlds and experimenting with game mechanics.

I’m always exploring new ways to combine creativity and technology—whether that’s through processing real-time data on the cloud or crafting immersive game experiences.
